# Project Documentation

## Introduction

This is a Practical Application Assignment for the Professional Certification in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence program at UC Berkeley Executive Education
A dataset is provided with information about the different characteristics and conditions of customers who were offered, while driving, a coupon for discounts in nearby food & drinks locations

## Objective

Demonstrate ability to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data using python libraries in order to answer specific questions and derive conclusions by identifying patterns and correlations within the data
Highlight the different factors that may determine if a customer decides to accept or reject a particular coupon 

## Procedure

The following steps were followed:

1. Reviewed each column in the dataset to simplify the naming convention and assignment of values
2. Documented changes and tracked the assignation of new names and values for future reference 
3. Identified columns that may be excluded due to irrelevance, ambiguity, or incomplete data
4. Filled in missing data in relevant columns
5. Organized columns in three main categories:

# Social
* Gender
* Age
* Marital status
* Children
* Frequency of use
* Type of passengers

# Economic
* Education
* Annual income

# Situational
* Driving destination
* Direction to location
* Time to location
* Coupon validity
* Time of the day
* Weather

6. Identified the acceptance rate for each coupon and selected the best a worst performing, takeaway and bar respectively, for comparison in order to identify which factors determined the difference in their success
7. Created a set of 6 visualizations to correlate the different factors and to compared between the groups that accepted and rejected the coupon

* Age, gender, marital status
* Marital status, type of passengers, gender, children
* Frequency of use, marital status, gender
* Anual income, education level
* Destination, direction to location, coupon validity, time to location
* Time of the day, weather

8. Repeated the process for both types of coupons
9. Compared results and drew conclusions

## Conclusions

Although both coupons are preferred by very similar demographic groups, the Bar coupons were heavily rejected by a couple of very specific groups
While Takeaway coupons are widely accepted throughout the day, Bar coupons were strongly preferred during early evening hours and mostly rejected before noon
Adjusting the targeted audience and timing the issuing of the coupon may significantly increase their acceptance
